					"Sugarloaf Mountain (1,282 feet) is a beautiful conservation and recreation area with a variety of small crags
					that have been a popular climbers' playground since the late 1940s. The highly fractured white quartzite
					on the mountain offers beginner and intermediate climbers plenty of lines on which to practice crack
					climbing, stemming, face climbing, friction, and pulling overhangs. While a few routes a leadable, toproping
					is the primary mode of climbing here."<br><br>
					
					"The three most popular outcrops are Middle Earth, The Pillar, and the Boy Scout Ledges. All are located
					near the summit of the mountain and only a few minutes from each other. A few other smaller crags, such
					as Devil's Kitchen and Mottled Wall, are located within the park, but not covered here due to their
					poor quality or limited number of routes. However, there is one excellent satellite crag known as
					White Rocks, located on the west side of the mountain. This steep, 40-foot cliff possesses the hardest routes
					at Sugarloaf, and it is the most popular destination for expert climbers visiting Sugarloaf Mountain"<br><br>
					
					"As a final note, this privately owned recreation area is open only from sunrise to sunset. Climbing here
					is a privilege that we can assume will continue as long as climbers maintain a good safety record and follow
					all regulations, including exiting the park before dark."
