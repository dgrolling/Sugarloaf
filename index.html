				   Situated just 30-40 minutes from the Washington, D.C. beltway in Frederick County, sits a monadnock called 
				   Sugarloaf Mountain. A monadnock is, geologically speaking, a stand-alone mountain separated from a chain. 
				   In Sugarloaf's case, most likely from the Appalachian Mountain range or from nearby Catoctin range. 
				   Though it only rises just under 1,300ft, Sugarloaf Mountain offers a plenty in terms of leisure.

				   If you're looking for an escape from nearby metro cities like Baltimore, Frederick, or Washington, D.C.,
				   you should be able to find something that will relax you while you're here. Sugarloaf offers nature viewing,
				   rock climbing, many miles of hiking trails, and what better way to cap off the day than to enjoy some regionally
				   crafted wine while listening to live music at Sugarloaf Winery.
