				"Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard grows the five Bordeaux red grapes (Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 
				Malbec and Petit Verdot) and three white grapes (Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Viognier). We have an 
				overriding commitment to quality, both in the vineyard and the winery. Open since May 2006, our wines have 
				been extremely well received and have won several awards."<br><br>

				"We age our wine in French oak barrels except for Pinot Grigio which we keep in large stainless steel tanks 
				to enhance a crisp flinty citric finish.  Our aging program calls for one to two plus years in the barrel 
				depending on the vintage (and our winemakerâ€™s call)."<br><br>

				"Our unique soil and microclimate create favorable growing conditions, or "terroir", for our carefully 
				selected grapevines. With the expertise of world renowned viticulturist Lucie Morton, in 2002 we selected 
				19,000 certified French vinifera clones which were grafted on American rootstock by Caldwell Nurseries of 
				northern California. We planted these babies in the spring of 2004, and additional vines of similar pedigree 
				in 2007 and 2008. The care and attention we have provided over the years has produced outstanding results. 
				We hand-pick our grapes, cold-soak them, cold-ferment all our varietals, and age them in French oak barrels 
				(except for our Pinot Grigio, which is aged in a special tank)."<br><br>

				"Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard has planted 3.5 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon, 2.5 acres of Pinot Grigio, 
				2 acres of Chardonnay, 1.5 acres of Merlot, 2 acres of Cabernet Franc, .5 acre of Petit Verdot, and .25 acre 
				of Malbec. We plan to plant an additional 15,000 certified French Bordeaux clones in the next several years."
